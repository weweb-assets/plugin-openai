# How to configure the OpenAI plugin

## 1. Configuration

Please enter your OpenAI secret API key to enable the plugin. The plugin will not work without a valid API key.

## 2. Secured prompts

In this section, you can add prompts with variables. This means you won't have to include your prompts in client-side requests if you don't want to.

The prompts you setup here at plugin level will be available in a dropdown menu in Workflows and will be included in the API request made server-side.
